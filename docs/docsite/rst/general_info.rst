Using and Developing in Ansible
********************************

Ansible consists of two main components:

* `ansible-core`: Provides the core funcionality of Ansible, including playbooks, inventories, tasks, and access to collections.
* curated selection of collections: a set of collections from Galaxy that includes all the modules and plugins that were part of Ansible 2.9.

Using Ansible
==============

See the `ansible-core User Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/index.html>`_

Developing in Ansible
=====================

Developing collections for Ansible depends on:

* The `ansible-core Developer Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/index.html>`_
* Specific developer requirements based on the collection you are contributing to. See the Contributing information in Galaxy for the collection.

Some types of collections share common contributing guidelines. These are also set out in the `ansible-core Developer Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/index.html>`_.
